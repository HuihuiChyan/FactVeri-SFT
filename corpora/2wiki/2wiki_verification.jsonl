However, the golden answer incorrectly states \"American,\" so the evaluation of the answers will be relative to this.\n\n- Answer 1: Laurie Lynd is not related to the film in question. Laurie Lynd is a Canadian director, thus this answer is factually incorrect in identifying the director and the place of birth.\n- Answer 2: Tennessee Williams was a playwright and not involved in directing this film. This answer is incorrect regarding both the identity and nationality of the director.\n- Answer 3: Steve Rifkind is not associated with this film either.

This answer is factually correct regarding the location of death, as it aligns with the golden answer. However, it incorrectly identifies the founder as James Roosevelt Bayley, which is factually incorrect.\n\n- **Answer 2** states that William Emory Demoor died in Baltimore, Maryland. This answer is incorrect because William Emory Demoor is not related to Seton Hall University, thus both the person's identity and the location do not match the golden answer.\n\n- **Answer 3** claims that Seton Hall University's founder was John Seton and that he died in 1938. This is incorrect on both the founder\u2019s name and the death year, and it does not provide a location, making it factually inaccurate compared to the golden answer.\n\nBased on the information provided, Answer 1 is the most factually correct because it correctly identifies the location of death as Newark, though it has an error in identifying the founder. Answer 3 is the next because it mentions the death of a founder, albeit with incorrect details, while Answer 2 is completely unrelated to the question.\n\nTherefore, the ranking is: Answer 1 > Answer 3 > Answer 2.", "verify_result": [1, 3, 2]}
