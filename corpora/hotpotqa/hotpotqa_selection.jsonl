The title \"King of Denmark, the Vend, and the Goths\" typically refers to a historical figure possibly relating to the early medieval period. If you're referring to Erik the Red, he was a Norse explorer known for founding the first Norse settlements in Greenland, not specifically for being a king of Denmark, Vend or Goths.\n\nAssuming you mean the Norse or Viking era, Erik the Red's brother was Thorvald, who also participated in Viking expeditions. They were both sons of Thorvald \u00c1svaldsson, a Norse explorer who was exiled from Iceland. Their history is mainly associated with expeditions to Greenland and Vinland (an area of North America that they believed to be another part of their homeland).\n\nHowever, it's crucial to understand that these titles and roles varied across different regions and times, and there was no 'King of Norway's brother' title during this period. The title 'King' referred to the ruler of a specific kingdom or region, not the brother of a 'King'.\n\nSo, if your question is about Erik the Red, his brother was Thorvald.
