It correctly states that Eddie Murphy won the Golden Raspberry for Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, and Worst Supporting Actress for the movie \"Norbit\" in 2007.\n\n2. **Answer 1**: This answer contains several factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly states that \"Evan Almighty\" earned Eddie Murphy the Golden Raspberry for Worst Actor. It also erroneously mentions other films such as \"Delgo\" and names actors not related to the awards Eddie Murphy received in 2007. The only correct part is that it mentions \"Norbit\" but in a confusing and incorrect context regarding the awards.\n\n3. **Answer 2**: This answer is completely incorrect. It states that \"The Hangover\" earned Eddie Murphy the Golden Raspberry for all three categories in 2007, which is factually wrong as \"The Hangover\" was released in 2009, and Eddie Murphy was not involved in that film.\n\nTherefore, the ranking is: Answer 3 > Answer 1 > Answer 2.", "verify_result": [3, 1, 2]}

It mentions \"Haddock,\" which is explicitly listed in the golden answer and is the primary type of fish used for Arbroath Smokies.\n\n- Answer 3: Partially Correct. It states \"Smoked haddock.\" While the fish used is indeed haddock, the term \"smoked\" refers to the preparation method rather than the type of fish itself. The core factual element needed here is the fish type, which is \"haddock.\"\n\nConsidering the above evaluations, Answer 2 directly and completely identifies the correct type of fish with factual accuracy.
