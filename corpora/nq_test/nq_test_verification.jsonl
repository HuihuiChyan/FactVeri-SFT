While it does not explicitly mention \"Sharecropping,\" it describes a similar situation that occurred in some feudal societies, where peasants kept a small portion of their crops and gave the rest to the landowners. However, it does not directly match the term \"Sharecropping,\" which is more specific and universally recognized for the described practice.\n\nAnswer 1 is the least factually correct. The term \"Tillers\" is a general term for people who work the land and does not specifically refer to the practice of sharing crops with landowners.

Therefore, this answer is partially correct but not fully aligned with the golden answer.\n\nAnswer 3 states \"The libretto,\" which directly matches one of the terms given in the golden answer, making it the most factually correct response.\n\nTherefore, the ranking is: Answer 3 > Answer 2 > Answer 1.", "verify_result": [3, 2, 1]}

The Soviet Union did not exist during the time of Jamestown's establishment, and it never took control of Jamestown.

While \"Captain John Smith\" includes an additional title, it does not detract from factual correctness and is fully aligned with the golden answer.\n\nTherefore, both Answer 2 and Answer 3 provide factually correct information.

While this date is in 1996, the NFL season associated with the Super Bowl mentioned is indeed the 1995 season. Therefore, this answer is factually correct in the context of the NFL season, despite the game itself being played in early 1996.\n\n- **Answer 2**: This answer states February 12, 2016, which is entirely incorrect. The Dallas Cowboys did not win the Super Bowl in 2016, making this answer factually incorrect.\n\n- **Answer 3**: The answer gives the date as February 6, 1996. Similar to Answer 1, this date is in 1996, which again refers to the Super Bowl that concluded the 1995 NFL season. Therefore, this answer is also factually correct in terms of the NFL season.\n\nIn conclusion, both Answer 1 and Answer 3 are factually correct as they accurately refer to the Super Bowl concluding the 1995 NFL season, despite listing dates in early 1996. However, Answer 1 provides a more accurate date for the Super Bowl (January 28, 1996), which is when the game actually occurred. Therefore, Answer 1 is slightly more accurate than Answer 3.
